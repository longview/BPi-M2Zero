# BPi-M2Zero
Various configs and stuff for Banana Pi M2-Zero

All my testing has been done on ARMbian 21.08.1 with kernel 5.10.60-sunxi (this is available in the community archive).
Note that I found upgrading to newer kernels broke several things including wired ethernet, so I've frozen at this version.
